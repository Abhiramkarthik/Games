\end{center}
\vspace{0.5cm}
{\large The rise of web technologies has significantly transformed how interactive content is developed and consumed. This project presents a dynamic, browser-based collection of mini-games, designed and implemented as a demonstration of full-stack web development skills. The application includes four popular and engaging games — Simon, Random Dice Roll, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Drum Play — each of which serves as a practical showcase of user interaction, logic handling, and real-time response mechanisms in a web environment. These games are built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end interface, and Node.js, Express.js, and EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for the server-side and templating components. Together, these technologies create a seamless and interactive user experience. }


{\large The Simon game is a memory-based challenge that tests the user's ability to repeat color and sound patterns. Its implementation demonstrates the use of event-driven programming and time-based sequence control. The Random Dice Roll game offers a simple yet effective way to simulate randomness in a user interface, showcasing logic control and UI updates. Tic-Tac-Toe, a strategic two-player game, is implemented with game state management, win condition checking, and dynamic UI rendering, making it an excellent example of logic-heavy game development in JavaScript. Lastly, Drum Play allows users to interact with virtual drums using keyboard inputs or mouse clicks, integrating sound playback and visual feedback, which emphasizes audio integration and real-time user response.}

\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

\section{Background}
{\large In the digital era, web-based games have gained popularity due to their accessibility, interactivity, and entertainment value. Developing such games using modern web technologies allows developers to merge creativity with functionality while enhancing their skills in full-stack development. This project explores the creation of a browser-based mini-game platform featuring four engaging games.}

\section{Objective}
{\large The primary aim of this project is to design and implement an interactive game platform using full-stack web development tools. Each game should:}
\begin{itemize}
   {\large \item Run directly in the browser
    \item Respond to user input in real time
    \item Demonstrate core logic, UI/UX, and event handling
    \item Be modular and maintainable}
\end{itemize}

\section{Technologies Used}
\begin{itemize}
    {\large\item HTML/CSS: Page structure and styling
    \item Node.js: Server-side runtime
    \item JavaScript: Game logic and interactivity
    \item Express.js: Web application framework for routing
    \item EJS: Template engine for rendering views dynamically}
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope}
{\large The system includes four mini-games:}
\begin{itemize}
    {\large\item Simon Game – Tests memory through pattern repetition
    \item Random Dice Roll – Simulates dice throwing
    \item Tic-Tac-Toe – Classic two-player logic game
    \item Drum Kit – A fun sound-based game triggered by keystrokes or mouse clicks}
\end{itemize}
{\large All games are accessible through a single interface hosted via an Express.js server.}

\section{Significance}
{\large This project is not just an entertainment platform—it demonstrates real-world skills in front-end and back-end integration. It serves as a strong base for future development involving multiplayer features, database integration, and deployment.}

\chapter{LITERATURE REVIEW}

\section{Evolution of Web-Based Games}

    {\large Jesse Schell’s The Art of Game Design is a foundational book in the field of game development and user experience. The book introduces the concept of "lenses"—perspectives through which designers can examine and refine their games. It emphasizes understanding the player's psychology, balancing challenge and reward, and aligning gameplay with intuitive design principles.}


\section{Front-End Technologies in Game Development}
{\large The JavaScript Guide on MDN Web Docs is a comprehensive and authoritative resource for learning JavaScript, one of the core technologies of web development. Maintained by Mozilla, this guide covers everything from basic syntax and data types to advanced topics like object-oriented programming, asynchronous programming (promises, async/await), and event handling.}

{\large EJS is a simple templating engine for JavaScript, primarily used with Node.js and Express.js to render dynamic content in HTML pages. It allows developers to embed JavaScript logic directly within HTML using special tags. This enables the creation of reusable components and dynamic pages based on server-side data. }

\section{Back-End Frameworks for Game Hosting}
{\large Express.js is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js, designed to build web applications and APIs efficiently. It simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests, routing, and middleware integration. Express provides robust features like dynamic routing, template engine support, and easy RESTful API creation, making it ideal for full-stack JavaScript development.}
\newpage
\chapter{Design}

{\large This section outlines the system design, user interface layout, application architecture, and technology integration used to develop the web-based mini-game platform.}

\section{System Architecture}

    {\large\item \textbf{Client-Server Model:} The application uses a client-server architecture, where the client (browser) interacts with a Node.js + Express server that delivers pages and handles logic.
    \item \textbf{Technology Stack:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
        \item Back-End: Node.js, Express.js
        \item Templating Engine: EJS (Embedded JavaScript)
        \item Runtime Environment: JavaScript (both client and server side)}
        
\end{itemize}

\vspace{2cm}
\section{Application Flow Design}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Routing Structure:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{/} - Home Page
        \item \texttt{/simon} - Simon Game
        \item \texttt{/dice} - Random Dice Roll
        \item \texttt{/tic-tac-toe} - Tic-Tac-Toe Game
        \item \texttt{/drum} - Drum Kit Game
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Request-Response Cycle:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The user navigates to a game route.
        \item The Express server renders the appropriate EJS view.
        \item The browser loads the game's interface and JavaScript logic.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{Game Module Design}
Each game is treated as a self-contained module with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An EJS template for structure.
    \item A CSS file for styling.
    \item A JavaScript file for gameplay logic.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example: Simon Game}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Functions: \texttt{startGame()}, \texttt{nextSequence()}, \texttt{checkAnswer()}
    \item Events: Button clicks
    \item Feedback: Color animations and sound cues
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example: Tic-Tac-Toe}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Functions: \texttt{makeMove()}, \texttt{checkWin()}, \texttt{resetGame()}
    \item Layout: 3x3 grid with alternating turns and win detection
\end{itemize}

\section{User Interface Design}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Responsive Design:} Designed for both mobile and desktop using media queries.
    \item \textbf{Consistent Layout:} A unified navigation bar allows switching between games.
    \item \textbf{User Feedback:} Visual and audio feedback like button animations and alert messages.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Principles Followed}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Separation of Concerns:} HTML handles structure, CSS handles appearance, JavaScript manages logic.
    \item \textbf{Modularity:} Games are structured as independent components.
    \item \textbf{Reusability:} Common elements like header and footer are reused across pages.
\end{itemize}
